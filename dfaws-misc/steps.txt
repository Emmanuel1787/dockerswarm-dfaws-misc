check defaults on env.sh create / adjust .env
run create-stack.sh
run check-stack-status.sh (waits for stack creation to be complete)
change UCPs controller port
  through the UI and change its ELB's target and healthcheck ports
  docker service update --add-env CONTROLLER_PORT=5443 ucp-agent
run update-ucp-listener.sh (to change the TLS port bound for UCP to a non-standard one)
optionally
  run update-dns.sh (to assign CNAME aliases for the associated load balancers)
  login into ucp and setup our external certs (run show-bootstrap-login-info.sh to obtain the elb's url)
run ./download-ucp-client-certs.sh to download the client certs
run eval $(./set-ucp-env.sh) (to set the environment variables needed to interact with the cluster)
update dtr certs
  properly place the certs to use in the certs directory
  run ./reconfigure-dtr.sh
  (if "ERRO[0081] Failed to check equal version: Failed version match. Replica
  version X.X.X doesn't match bootstrap version Y.Y.Y.", adjust parameters as needed)
  (if needed) point DTR to the correct S3 bucket
    modify the IAM role to grant it permissions or setup credentials which have permissions
  if running into trouble uninstalling and reinstalling the dtr is a last resort
    run uninstall-dtr.sh as many times as needed (an interactive dialog will ask for the host to remove the replica from)
    run install-dtr.sh supplying the private dns name for the node to install to
    run join-dtr.sh supplying the private dns name for another node to install to and the existing replica id provided by the install command
    
? create the necessary DTR repositories
login into the DTR (take care not to do it from the same terminal session that's pointing to UCP), by executing ./ucp/login.sh
